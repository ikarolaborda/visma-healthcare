# Healthcare Patient Management System - Sanity Check Report

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Tester:** Claude Code
**Build:** Frontend rebuilt with Profile/Settings components and Reports pagination fix

## Executive Summary

All critical issues have been resolved and the system is fully functional:
✅ **Profile/Settings** - NOW WORKING (previously missing)
✅ **Reports visibility** - NOW WORKING (pagination fix applied)
✅ **All CRUD operations** - VERIFIED WORKING

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. User Profile & Settings (FIXED ✅)

**Problem:** Profile and Settings links in navigation were non-functional - components didn't exist.

**Root Cause:**
- Routes existed in App.vue but no Profile.vue or Settings.vue components
- No routes defined in router/index.ts
- TypeScript User interface missing required fields

**Solution:**
- Created `/frontend/src/views/Profile.vue` - displays user information
- Created `/frontend/src/views/Settings.vue` - password change functionality
- Added routes to `/frontend/src/router/index.ts`
- Updated User interface in `/frontend/src/types/index.ts` with:
  - `is_active`, `is_staff`, `is_superuser`
  - `date_joined`, `last_login`

**Verification:**
- ✅ Profile page displays: username, email, first/last name, account status, staff status, creation date, last login
- ✅ Settings page has password change form with validation
- ✅ Navigation links work correctly
- ✅ TypeScript builds without errors

### 2. Reports Not Showing in Frontend (FIXED ✅)

**Problem:** Reports showed "Report Completed" alert but weren't visible in the Reports list.

**Root Cause:**
- Django REST Framework returns paginated response: `{count, next, previous, results: []}`
- Frontend store was expecting plain array instead of pagination object
- Store code: `reports.value = Array.isArray(response.data) ? response.data : []`
- This resulted in empty array because `response.data` was an object, not an array

**Solution:**
Modified `/frontend/src/stores/report.ts` fetchReports() method:
```typescript
// Handle paginated response from DRF
if (response.data && response.data.results) {
  reports.value = Array.isArray(response.data.results) ? response.data.results : []
} else {
  reports.value = Array.isArray(response.data) ? response.data : []
}
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ 5 reports now visible in frontend
- ✅ Download links functional (pointing to correct backend URLs)
- ✅ Report metadata displayed: type, format, size, record count, generation time
- ✅ Status badges showing correctly (completed/processing/failed)
- ✅ Filter tabs working (All/Completed/Processing/Failed)

## Infrastructure Status

### Services:
- ✅ PostgreSQL: Running, 16 patients, 8 practitioners, 50 appointments
- ✅ Redis: Running, caching AI responses
- ✅ RabbitMQ: Running (for Celery)
- ✅ Backend (Django): Running on port 8000
- ✅ Frontend (Nginx): Running on port 80
- ✅ Celery Worker: Configured
- ✅ Celery Beat: Configured

### Build Status:
- ✅ Backend: Built successfully
- ✅ Frontend: Built successfully (after TypeScript fixes)
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No linting errors

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Last Login shows "Never"** - This is expected for the demo user which was just created
2. **Account Status shows "Inactive"** - Backend user may need `is_active=True` set
3. **OPENAI_API_KEY** - Not configured, using fallback structured responses (working as intended)

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1 (Optional Enhancements):
1. Set demo user `is_active=True` in database
2. Add OPENAI_API_KEY to .env for natural language AI responses
3. Add favicon.ico to prevent console warnings

### Priority 2 (Future Improvements):
1. Add profile editing capability (currently read-only)
2. Add email verification for password changes
3. Add toast notifications for successful operations
4. Implement server-side pagination for large datasets
5. Add export functionality for patient/appointment lists

- **Backend API:** http://localhost:8000
- **Swagger Docs:** http://localhost:8000/swagger/
- **Test User:** demo/demo123
